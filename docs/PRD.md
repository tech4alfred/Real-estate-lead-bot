PRD --- Real Estate Lead Bot

Product: PrimeHomes Realty --- Real Estate Lead Bot Document: Product
Requirements Document (PRD) Version: 1.0 Status: Draft Primary Stack:
React + FastAPI + n8n + SQL Database + Google Sheets Product Type:
AI-powered Lead Management & Qualification System

1.  Executive Summary

PrimeHomes Realty receives potential customer enquiries through digital
channels. These enquiries vary significantly in structure, completeness,
and intent.

For example:

"Hi, I'm looking for a 3-bedroom apartment around Lekki. My budget is
around ₦80 million."

Another customer may simply say:

"Hello, I want to buy a house."

The current manual process requires sales representatives to read
messages, understand customer requirements, extract relevant
information, determine lead quality, respond to the customer, and follow
up.

At higher message volumes, this creates several problems:

Slow response times Incomplete lead information Missed opportunities
Inconsistent lead qualification Poor follow-up Difficulty tracking
customer progress Lack of centralized lead information Proposed Solution

The Real Estate Lead Bot will act as an AI-powered digital receptionist
for PrimeHomes Realty.

The system will:

Receive customer messages. Understand customer intent. Extract
structured requirements. Identify missing information. Continue the
conversation when necessary. Create and store a lead. Score and classify
the lead. Respond appropriately to the customer. Notify the sales team
when required. Allow sales representatives to follow up. Track the lead
lifecycle. Maintain a record of customer interactions.

The system will use:

React for the customer-facing interface, FastAPI for backend APIs and
business logic, n8n for workflow orchestration and integrations, AI
services for natural-language understanding, SQL as the primary
structured database, and Google Sheets where lightweight operational
visibility or n8n-based reporting is useful.

2.  Product Vision

To provide real estate companies with an intelligent digital
receptionist that can automatically understand, organize, qualify, and
route potential customers while keeping human sales representatives in
control of the final sales process.

The system is not intended to replace sales representatives.

Instead:

AI handles repetitive qualification and organization.

Sales representatives handle relationship building and closing.

3.  Business Problem

PrimeHomes Realty may receive hundreds of enquiries from potential
customers.

These enquiries contain valuable information, but the information is
usually unstructured.

For example:

"I need a 3 bedroom somewhere around Lekki, budget is about 80m and I
want to move in soon."

Important information exists inside the sentence:

Intent: Buying Property Type: Apartment Bedrooms: 3 Location: Lekki
Budget: ₦80,000,000 Timeline: Immediate / Short-term

Without automation, a sales representative must manually extract this
information.

At scale, this can result in:

Leads not being recorded Important information being missed Slow
responses Inconsistent qualification Poor prioritization Lost leads
Difficult reporting Poor visibility into sales pipeline 4. Problem
Statement Current State

Potential customers send enquiries through digital channels.

Sales representatives manually:

Read message ↓ Understand customer ↓ Extract requirements ↓ Ask missing
questions ↓ Record information ↓ Determine lead quality ↓ Respond ↓
Follow up Desired State

The system should automate much of this process:

Customer Message ↓ AI Understanding ↓ Information Extraction ↓ Lead
Qualification ↓ Database ↓ Customer Response ↓ Sales Notification ↓
Human Follow-up ↓ Lead Tracking 5. Product Goals Primary Goals G1 ---
Automate Lead Capture

Automatically convert customer messages into structured lead records.

G2 --- Understand Natural Language

Allow customers to communicate naturally rather than forcing them to
complete a rigid form.

G3 --- Extract Customer Requirements

Extract relevant property and customer information from conversations.

G4 --- Qualify Leads

Determine the potential value and urgency of a lead using defined
business rules.

G5 --- Improve Response Time

Provide an immediate response to customers whenever possible.

G6 --- Reduce Sales Team Workload

Remove repetitive information collection and data entry from the sales
process.

G7 --- Improve Lead Visibility

Give the sales team a structured view of leads and their current status.

G8 --- Enable Follow-up

Ensure leads can be assigned, contacted, updated, and tracked.

G9 --- Maintain Data Consistency

Create a reliable structured record of each lead and its interactions.

6.  Non-Goals

The first version should not attempt to become a complete real estate
ERP/CRM.

The following are outside the initial MVP:

Full property marketplace Property listing management Property valuation
Automated negotiation Automated contract generation Payment processing
Property ownership verification Legal document management Automated
sales closing Mortgage processing Advanced predictive sales forecasting
Fully autonomous AI sales agent AI making binding commitments to
customers

The AI should assist the sales process, not make decisions that require
human authorization.

7.  Target Users 7.1 Potential Customer / Lead

A person interested in:

Buying property Renting property Buying land Selling property Enquiring
about available properties

They interact primarily with the bot.

7.2 Sales Representative

Responsible for:

Reviewing leads Contacting customers Following up Updating lead status
Scheduling meetings/viewings Converting qualified leads 7.3 Sales
Manager

Responsible for:

Monitoring leads Assigning leads Reviewing team performance Monitoring
high-value leads Reviewing pipeline Managing qualification rules 7.4
System Administrator

Responsible for:

System configuration User management Integration configuration
Monitoring Managing system-level settings 8. Core User Journey

The primary journey is:

Customer arrives ↓ Starts conversation ↓ Bot welcomes customer ↓
Customer describes requirement ↓ AI understands message ↓ Information
extracted ↓ Missing information identified ↓ Bot asks relevant questions
↓ Lead becomes sufficiently qualified ↓ Lead scored ↓ Lead stored ↓
Customer receives response ↓ Sales team notified ↓ Sales representative
follows up ↓ Lead status updated ↓ Lead eventually converted/lost 9.
Core Lead Information

The system should maintain structured information about each lead.

9.1 Customer Information lead_id name email phone
preferred_contact_channel

Some fields may initially be unknown.

The system must not invent missing information.

9.2 Property Requirements property_type bedrooms bathrooms location
preferred_locations budget_min budget_max currency property_condition

Potential property types:

Apartment House Duplex Terrace Detached House Land Commercial Property
Office Other 9.3 Transaction Intent transaction_type

Possible values:

BUY RENT SELL INQUIRE 9.4 Timeline

Possible values:

IMMEDIATE WITHIN_1\_MONTH WITHIN_3\_MONTHS WITHIN_6\_MONTHS RESEARCHING
UNKNOWN 9.5 Lead Status

Example lifecycle:

NEW QUALIFYING QUALIFIED ASSIGNED CONTACTED ENGAGED VIEWING_SCHEDULED
NEGOTIATING CONVERTED LOST NURTURE

The exact state machine will be defined in the System Architecture /
Technical Specification.

10. AI Requirements

The AI layer should perform several specific tasks.

10.1 Intent Detection

Determine what the customer is trying to accomplish.

Example:

"I need to rent a 2-bedroom apartment in Ikeja."

Output:

{ "intent": "RENT", "property_type": "APARTMENT", "bedrooms": 2,
"location": "Ikeja" } 10.2 Entity Extraction

Extract structured information from natural language.

Example:

"I have about ₦80m and need a 3-bedroom around Lekki."

Output:

{ "property_type": "APARTMENT", "bedrooms": 3, "location": "Lekki",
"budget_max": 80000000, "currency": "NGN" } 10.3 Missing Information
Detection

The AI should determine what important information is still missing.

Example:

Known: Property: Apartment Bedrooms: 3 Location: Lekki

Missing: Budget Timeline Contact information

The bot can then ask:

"Great. What budget range are you working with?"

10.4 Conversation Understanding

The system must maintain conversation context.

Example:

Customer:

I need a house in Lekki.

Bot:

Sure. Are you looking to buy or rent?

Customer:

Buy.

The system should understand that:

transaction_type = BUY location = Lekki property_type = HOUSE

rather than treating "Buy" as an independent enquiry.

11. Lead Qualification

The system should assign a lead score based on defined business rules.

The score should initially be explainable and deterministic, rather than
relying entirely on an AI-generated score.

For example:

Signal Example Budget provided +20 Phone/email provided +15 Specific
location +15 Specific property requirement +15 Immediate timeline +20
Clear buying/renting intent +10 Very vague enquiry -10

Example:

Lead Score: 85 Classification: HOT

Possible classification:

HOT WARM COLD UNQUALIFIED Important requirement

The AI may extract signals, but the backend/workflow should ideally
perform the final scoring using documented rules.

This keeps qualification:

Explainable Testable Auditable Consistent 12. Lead Routing

Once qualified, the system should determine what happens next.

Example:

Score \>= 80 ↓ HOT ↓ Immediate Sales Notification Score 50--79 ↓ WARM ↓
Normal Sales Queue Score \< 50 ↓ COLD ↓ Nurture / Follow-up

Routing rules should eventually be configurable rather than hard-coded
wherever practical.

13. Customer Response Requirements

The bot should provide appropriate responses based on the current
conversation state.

Example --- Complete Lead

Customer:

"I need a 3-bedroom apartment in Lekki. Budget is ₦80m. I want to buy
within two months."

Bot:

"Thanks! I've captured your requirements for a 3-bedroom apartment in
Lekki with a budget around ₦80 million. Our sales team will review
suitable options and get back to you shortly."

Example --- Missing Information

Customer:

"I want a 3-bedroom apartment in Lekki."

Bot:

"Absolutely. Are you looking to buy or rent, and what budget range are
you considering?"

Example --- Very Vague

Customer:

"I want a house."

Bot:

"Sure, I'd be happy to help. Are you looking to buy or rent, and which
location are you interested in?"

14. Human Handoff

AI should not attempt to handle every situation indefinitely.

The system should support escalation to a human sales representative.

Triggers may include:

Customer explicitly requests a human High-value lead Customer expresses
urgency Complex enquiry AI confidence below threshold Complaint
Negotiation Sensitive issue AI unable to understand request

Example:

AI ↓ "Human assistance required" ↓ Sales Team

The conversation history and extracted lead information should be
available to the sales representative.

15. Sales Team Requirements

Sales representatives should be able to:

View leads Lead ID Customer Intent Property Location Budget Score
Priority Status Assigned Agent Created At Last Contact Update lead

They should be able to modify:

Status Assignment Notes Priority Follow-up date Contact outcome Follow
up

The system should support recording:

Contacted Call completed WhatsApp contacted Meeting scheduled Property
viewing Customer requested more options No response Converted Lost 16.
Lead Lifecycle

The system should maintain a traceable lifecycle.

NEW ↓ QUALIFYING ↓ QUALIFIED ↓ ASSIGNED ↓ CONTACTED ↓ ENGAGED ↓
VIEWING_SCHEDULED ↓ NEGOTIATING ↓ CONVERTED

Alternative outcome:

CONTACTED ↓ NO RESPONSE ↓ NURTURE

or:

QUALIFIED ↓ LOST

Every significant state change should ideally be recorded in an
activity/history log.

17. System Components

The product will initially consist of five major layers.

1.  React Frontend

Responsible for:

Chat UI Lead forms Sales dashboard Lead details Status management
Follow-up interface 2. FastAPI Backend

Responsible for:

API endpoints Request validation Authentication/authorization Business
logic Lead operations Database access where appropriate Security
Integration boundaries 3. n8n

Responsible primarily for:

Workflow orchestration Trigger handling AI workflow execution
Notifications Integrations Google Sheets synchronization Follow-up
automation 4. SQL Database

The SQL database will be the primary system of record for structured
application data.

Potential candidates:

PostgreSQL MySQL

The final choice will be documented in the Architecture/Database
specification.

5.  Google Sheets

Google Sheets may be used for:

Operational visibility Simple reporting Sales-team exports n8n-friendly
business workflows Temporary/secondary operational data

Important architectural principle:

Google Sheets should not automatically become the authoritative database
if a SQL database is being used.

The architecture document will define exactly which data belongs in SQL
versus Sheets.

18. Functional Requirements FR-001 --- Receive Customer Message

The system must be able to receive a customer message through the
supported frontend/channel.

FR-002 --- Validate Incoming Data

The system must validate incoming requests before processing.

Invalid requests should return structured errors.

FR-003 --- Create Conversation

The system must associate messages with a conversation/session.

FR-004 --- Process Customer Message

The system must send relevant customer messages to the AI processing
workflow.

FR-005 --- Extract Lead Information

The system must extract relevant structured information.

FR-006 --- Preserve Unknown Fields

If information is not provided, the system must represent it as
unknown/null rather than inventing values.

FR-007 --- Identify Missing Information

The system must determine whether additional information is needed to
qualify the lead.

FR-008 --- Generate Response

The system must generate an appropriate response based on:

Current conversation Known lead information Missing information Business
rules FR-009 --- Calculate Lead Score

The system must calculate a lead score according to defined
qualification rules.

FR-010 --- Classify Lead

The system must classify leads according to their score and/or business
rules.

FR-011 --- Store Lead

Qualified and captured leads must be persisted in the SQL database.

FR-012 --- Notify Sales Team

The system must notify the relevant sales team when defined conditions
are met.

FR-013 --- Assign Lead

Authorized sales users must be able to assign leads.

FR-014 --- Update Lead Status

Authorized users must be able to update lead lifecycle status.

FR-015 --- Record Follow-up

The system must allow sales representatives to record follow-up
activities.

FR-016 --- View Conversation History

Authorized users should be able to view relevant customer conversation
history.

FR-017 --- Track Lead Activity

Important lead events should be recorded.

Example:

Lead Created AI Qualified Score Changed Assigned Sales Contacted Status
Changed Follow-up Scheduled Converted Lost 19. Non-Functional
Requirements

These are extremely important because this is a real system rather than
just an automation demo.

Performance

The system should provide an initial acknowledgement quickly, even if AI
processing takes longer.

Where appropriate:

Request ↓ Immediate acknowledgement ↓ Asynchronous processing

rather than keeping the client connection open unnecessarily.

Reliability

Failures in one component should not unnecessarily destroy the entire
lead.

For example:

AI fails ↓ Lead should still be recorded where possible Security

The system should:

Authenticate internal users Authorize actions Protect customer
information Secure API endpoints Protect secrets Validate external
requests Avoid exposing internal system details Log security-relevant
events Observability

The system should provide:

Application logs Workflow logs Error tracking Request identifiers AI
processing status Lead processing status Scalability

The architecture should initially support the expected workload while
allowing future scaling.

The system should not prematurely introduce unnecessary microservices.

A modular monolith + n8n orchestration approach may be sufficient
initially.

20. Data Ownership Principle

This needs to be established early.

SQL Database

System of Record

Contains:

Users Leads Conversations Messages Lead Scores Assignments Follow-ups
Activities Statuses Google Sheets

Operational / Reporting Layer

Potentially contains:

Lead summaries Sales reports Exports Simple operational views n8n

Workflow State / Orchestration

n8n should coordinate processes rather than become the permanent source
of truth for business data.

21. AI Safety & Reliability Requirements

The AI must follow several constraints.

AI must not invent customer information.

Bad:

Customer didn't provide budget.

AI: budget = ₦50m

Correct:

budget = null AI must not invent property availability.

If the system does not have verified property inventory, it must not
claim:

"We have a 3-bedroom apartment available in Lekki for ₦80m."

Instead:

"I've captured your requirements. A member of our sales team can confirm
suitable available properties."

AI must distinguish extracted facts from assumptions.

For example:

Customer: "I have about 80m."

AI: budget_max = 80000000

But:

Customer: "I don't want anything too expensive."

AI: budget = unknown 22. Error Handling

The system must gracefully handle:

AI Failure AI unavailable ↓ Fallback response ↓ Record event ↓ Allow
retry / human handoff Database Failure

The system should prevent silent data loss and record failures for
retry/recovery.

n8n Failure

Workflow failures should be observable and retryable where appropriate.

Invalid Customer Input

The bot should politely ask for clarification rather than failing
technically.

23. Success Metrics

The MVP should be measured using metrics such as:

Lead Capture Rate

Percentage of enquiries successfully converted into lead records.

Response Time

Average time between customer message and initial response.

Lead Qualification Rate

Percentage of leads for which sufficient qualification information is
captured.

Sales Notification Time

Time between qualification and sales-team notification.

Follow-up Rate

Percentage of qualified leads receiving human follow-up.

Conversion Rate

Percentage of leads eventually converted.

AI Extraction Accuracy

Percentage of extracted fields that match human judgement.

(The remainder of the original PRD content continues with additional sections on success metrics, out of scope, and implementation notes. The bulk of the document has been moved.)
